# Color Guessing Game

This project is a fun and interactive color guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players are presented with a set of colors and must select the correct one based on the displayed color in the big box.

## How to Play:

1. Click on the color option that matches the displayed color.
2. If you choose correctly, a confetti effect appears, and your score increases.
3. If you choose incorrectly, all colors fade out and a "Wrong" message appears.
4. A new round starts automatically after a short delay.
